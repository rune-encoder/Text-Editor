## Description

**Deployed Application URL:** **_[Ultimate Text Editor Heroku App](https://ultimate-text-editor-8e7837a44f32.herokuapp.com/)_**

Welcome to the Ultimate Text Editor project! This is a browser-based text editor with powerful features that provide both online and offline needs. Using this text editor you may edit your code snipets or type your notes.

The text editor not only allows you to _create and manage notes and code snippets_ but _also makes certain your data is always available_, whether you have an internet connection or not. You are also able to _install the app locally_ and use it even when not connected to the internet.

This project incorporates the use of various web technologies, including Progressive Web App (PWA), IndexedDB for data storage, Webpack for bundling, and a service worker for caching assets.

## Usage

> **_To get started..._**

1. Navigate to the following link: **_[Ultimate Text Editor Deployed Heroku App](https://ultimate-text-editor-8e7837a44f32.herokuapp.com/)_**  
   **_OR_**
2. Follow the _installation instructions_ and run it locally.

> **_Finally, here are some ways to use this application_**

1. **Create and Edit your "Notes" or "Code Snippets":**

   - Click anywhere within the text editor to start typing your notes or code snippets.

   - As you type, your content is automatically saved to IndexedDB in the background. This means that even if you accidentally close the browser or lose your internet connection, your data will be accessible when you return to the application.

2. **Installing as a Progressive Web App:**

   - If you want to have quick access to the _Ultimate Text Editor_ on your desktop just like a regular app, you can install it as a Progressive Web App by clicking the _"Install"_ button on the top left corner. You will then be prompted to install the application.

   - Now, you can launch the _Ultimate Text Editor_ directly from your desktop or home screen like any other application.

3. **Offline Mode:**

   - The _Ultimate Text Editor_ is designed to work without an internet connection. So, if you're in a location with no Wi-Fi or a data signal, you can continue to create and edit your content.

   - When you're offline, the application switches to its offline mode. All of your changes are saved locally to IndexedDB. When the internet is back online, your local changes are then synced with the server.

## Technologies Used

- **Webpack**: Bundles JavaScript files for an efficient user experience.
- **Workbox**: Employs a service worker to cache assets, enhancing performance and enabling offline access.
- **IndexedDB**: Stores content in a reliable and redundant database with offline capabilities.
- **Babel**: Transpiles code to utilize modern ES6+ JavaScript features.
- **PWA Integration**: Allows installation as a Progressive Web Application.
- **Server and Development Tools**: Includes Express, Concurrently, and Nodemon for server development and monitoring.
